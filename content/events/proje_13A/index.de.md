Infinite Jest is a spin-off project of the Breakfast Basketball Club, which in turn was conceived one sweltering hot afternoon in a high-rise office building, when the lady workers collectively dreamt of having a hot girl summer. Infinite Jest connects playfulness, a swooshy feeling like the sensation of a basketball going through a hoop to drop down with the weight of narcissism. The heaviness of deception in daily life meets fast reactions, transforming weight into movement action and dopamine kicks.
