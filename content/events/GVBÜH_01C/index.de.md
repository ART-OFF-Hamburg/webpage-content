Katharina Duve - (Im)possible identities - What can we learn from ghosts - Six portraits, consisting of found objects, are placed under a live-video camera and linked to stories of ghost indentities from Yogyakarta/ Indonesia. How can those biographies help us to lose our fear about the unknown and widen our imagination about the variety of personal features? Katharina Duve, is an interdisciplinary artist in the field of experimental film, performance and costume. She is editing and assambling a montage of essay films, music videos, live-video lecture performances, assemblages or costumes which broach improbable identities, diverse body concepts and economic chains.
