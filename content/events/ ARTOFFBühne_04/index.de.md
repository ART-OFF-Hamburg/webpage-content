When asked about his obvious preference for lawnmowers, Melle deBoer, head of the Dutch alternative-folk-band Smutfish replies: "They are a typical tool of my home country Holland; an expression of smalltown, bourgeois density in all those backyards. I also like keeping things short. I think I have a destructive nature."
