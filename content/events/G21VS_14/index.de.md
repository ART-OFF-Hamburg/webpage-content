A story that describes how a caterpillar changes herself and how some deeper transformations are slow and cautious. In her procese the caterpillar meets a talkative Bee who knows a lot about  flowers and will meet Nettle, a Plant that looks scary but is very friendly. A big storm will scare the friends but the sun will come and with the freshness of the rain new flowers will grow and the caterpillar will turn into a butterfly.

Growth, transformation and expansion though changes. The Puppen will be made by hand with paint cardboard as well the Signaling of the Plants.
