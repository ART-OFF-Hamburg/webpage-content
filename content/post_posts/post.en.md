Besides these tours, there are a number of individual events that will usher in the Art Walks and, later on, bring the summer to a gradual close.

ART OFF HAMBURG Kultursommer is being supported as part of the programme Kultursommer 2021 by the Federal Minister for Culture and Media (BKM) with funds from the NEUSTART KULTUR programme 
amounting to 500,000 Euros. In addition, the project has received 125,000 Euros funding from Hamburgâ€™s Ministry of Culture and Media.
