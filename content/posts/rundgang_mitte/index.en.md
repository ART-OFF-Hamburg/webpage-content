The second series of events in the ART OFF Kultursommer focuses on the districts of Hamburg Central and St. Pauli. This tour starts, for example, in St. Pauli and the Karolinenviertel quarter, 
where [Galerie Genscher](/places/galerie_genscher/) and [Vorwerkstift](/places/k_nstlerhaus_vorwerk-stift/) are to be found. From there, the route meanders through the city park Planten un Blomen, where concerts and performances can be viewed in the 
park’s natural setting.

From the park, it is not far to the Gängeviertel and its galleries [Galerie LaDöns](/places/galerie_lad_ns/), [Galerie Speckstraße](/places/galerie_speckstra_e/), [mom art space](/places/mom_art_space/) and [Raum linksrechts](/places/raum_links-rechts/), while the [Kunst-Imbiss](/places/kunst-imbiss/) can be 
found in close vicinity in the arcaded street of the Colonnaden. Last but not least, you should not miss the events taking place in and around [Westwerk](/places/westwerk/) between the canals of the Neustadt quarter.
