The third series of ART OFF HAMBURG Art Walks will take place in Hamburgâ€™s west end. Starting in the St. Pauli and Altona districts, the tours proceed to Bahrenfeld and Ottensen---or vice versa. 
The independent art spaces *2025*, *8. Salon*, *Frappant*, *Frise* and *hinterconti* will be presenting numerous outdoor projects. There is plenty to explore along the Grosse Bergstrasse or the 
Reeperbahn and, once again, you will encounter the ever-mobile *Kunstimbiss*.
