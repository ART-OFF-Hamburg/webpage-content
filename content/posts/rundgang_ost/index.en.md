The ART OFF Kultursommer kicks off with a series of Art Walks exploring the east end of Hamburg. Each tour links up numerous events due to be held outdoors in the neighbourhoods of those art 
spaces participating in the programme, and en route between them. The tours pass through the districts of St. Georg, Hammerbrook, Rothenburgsort and Wandsbek. This Art Walk joins up the following 
art spaces and initiatives: *Einstellungsraum*, *Billekraftwerk/Hallo e.V.*, *Kunst-Imbiss*, *Künstlerhaus Wendenstraße/Studio 45*, *Mikropol*, *nachtspeicher23*, *noroomgallery*, *Oel-Früh*, 
*Projektgruppe*, *xpon-art gallery* und *Zollo*. In addition, we are glad to welcome on board the *Fabrik der Künste*, offering a glimpse of the “Positions” of the BBK, the professional association of 
visual artists.
