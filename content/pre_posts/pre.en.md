# We are here. ART OFF’s “Kultursommer”.

The cultural programme of “Kultursommer” presented by ART OFF HAMBURG, the association of independent art spaces, will be launched in **late July** and extends beyond the core period of the Hamburg’s 
citywide cultural summer. Through **till mid-September**, Hamburg’s streets will become venues for the artistic activities of ART OFF’s “We are here”.

With three Art Walks and two excursions, ART OFF HAMBURG aims to rekindle public enthusiasm for art, culture and urban strolling. Numerous exhibition spaces and open-air venues will be presenting 
art, concerts, performances, dance and literature. Over 400 cultural producers are involved. Special projects have also been devised with children and young people in mind. As ever with ART OFF 
HAMBURG, admission is free.

To quote Carsten Brosda, Hamburg’s senator for culture and media: “The independent art spaces are part of Hamburg’s cultural DNA. Their contribution is a crucial element in the city’s summer of 
culture. With immense commitment and within a very short time, ART OFF HAMBURG has compiled a very special and diverse programme, inviting us to explore art and culture that lie beyond the 
familiar grid. As the people of Hamburg emerge from lockdown, this offers an opportunity to rediscover the cultural riches of our city. ART OFF HAMBURG’s ‘Kultursommer’ promises to be one of the 
highlights of our citywide summer of culture programme which has been made possible thanks to the generous support of the German Federal Foundation.”
