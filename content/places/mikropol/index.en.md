In response to the demolition of the former neighborhood center, Mikropol opened in summer 2019. An about 50m2 brick building in the middle of a traffic island in Hamburg Rothenburgsort. Mikropol's program evolves from two approaches: ongoing events "by neighbors for neighbors" and the program of the curatorial team. The team's main task is to regularly situate activities in and around Mikropol in order to engage with urban political discourses and to put these discourses into practice. In doing so, the building is an argument, a test site and an exhibition space all in one.
