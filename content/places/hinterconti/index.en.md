Hinterconti has been organising exhibitions of Hamburg-based and international artists since its inception in 1999. As a well-known project room,
hinterconti provides a platform for artistic practice and production processes. Hinterconti is a space for testing ideas, discussing artistic methods
and showing works in progress. Guest artists are welcome to live and work at the exhibition space in the summer months.
