The noroomgallery produces forms of presenting and communicating art
beyond the “white cube” format. Its focus is not on “what” but on “how”.
In various acclaimed projects and the now regularly held “ArtHatersRound-
Table” it has explored and visibly articulated different forms of access to
art. As a gallery without a permanent space it pops up at selected sites
around Hamburg in order to show connections and cooperations between
art and other social fields.
