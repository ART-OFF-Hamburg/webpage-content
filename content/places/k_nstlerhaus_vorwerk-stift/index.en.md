Artists from different countries and generations have been living together in the Vorwerk-Stift for some 30 years. In their large residential building
with its spacious garden members organise cultural events, concerts, summer festivals and flea markets. The in-house art space Galerie 21
hosts regular exhibitions. During their short-term residences guest artists from Germany and abroad also participate in the house’s activities.
