Raum linksrechts in the Gängeviertel offers young Hamburg artists the
chance to experiment with mixed-genre exhibition concepts. Its exhibition
programme is characterised by the special nature of the gallery layout
consisting of two separate rooms either side of the entrance: the left
room is white, the right one is black. This contrast is echoed in the gallery’s
core concept and openness to different forms of artistic expression.
