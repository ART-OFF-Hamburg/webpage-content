The refurbished space on the ground floor of the Fabrique covering
approx. 90 sq. m. provides quasi-institutional conditions for hosting
exhibitions. Since its reopening in March 2016, it gives space, not unlike
a White Cube, for expansive installations as well as classic exhibition
displays. mom art space is one of the hearts of the GÃ¤ngeviertel socio-cultural
complex, established when the buildings were occupied in 2009.
