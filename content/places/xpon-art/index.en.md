The xpon-art gallery is a 200 sq. m. project space in the MuÌˆnzburg quarter
that dates back to 1886. The space focuses on thematic group exhibitions
of contemporary art. The gallery seeks to shape and promote a position
between commercial galleries and self-organised exhibitions of emerging
artists. Xpon-art cooperates with universities, collectives and freelance
curators.
