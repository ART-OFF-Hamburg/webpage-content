The Kunst-Imbiss is constantly changing location. It is a point of contact
on streets and squares, wherever one would least expect to find art on
offer. Through its unassuming “disguise” as a mobile food vendor and the
performative way in which it operates, Kunst-Imbiss succeeds in reducing
the inhibitions and reservations of people otherwise unaccustomed to art.
More than 100 artists participate/are represented in the project, but its
key focus is less on the works than on the ideas behind them.
