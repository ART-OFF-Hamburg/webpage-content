The two unrenovated apartments on the mezzanine floor covering about
100 sq. m. offer an unfamiliar setting for a gallery. Above all, experimentally
minded artists working on unusual art projects are invited to show
here. The patina of the walls and the very particular charm of the house’s
old rooms bring to bear especially in group exhibitions.
