The artists’ house was converted by the Hamburg Ministry of Arts in
1994. It is run by the association Ateliers für die Kunst e.V. On their own
initiative and expense, the resident artists converted a storage room of
approx. 100 sq. m. into a gallery. This now serves as a meeting place and
information centre about contemporary art. Since its inception member
artists have presented some 100 solo and group shows.
