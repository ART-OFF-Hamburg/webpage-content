Bildwechsel is a self-organised association of women artists and activists
that has been operating since 1979. It maintains two unique and constantly
growing archives of (video) work by women+ artists. In order to
preserve and expand its collection and its network, as well as to present
its broad spectrum of work in ever-changing and new ways, bildwechsel
organises a wide range of artistic activities.
