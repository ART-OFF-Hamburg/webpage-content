Frappant is considered a major player in the city’s art scene, hosting a
versatile programme that makes a stimulating contribution to cultural
dialogue within and beyond Hamburg. In a former barracks in Altona, now
a listed building, Frappant’s 130 qm exhibition spaces offer a varying exhibition
programme, interspersed with concerts, readings and discussions.
With a reputation that stretches far beyond Hamburg, Frappant, celebrates
its tenth anniversary in 2019.
