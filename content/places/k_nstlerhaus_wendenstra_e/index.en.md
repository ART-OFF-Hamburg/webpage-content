Künstlerhaus Wendenstrasse is a community of artists’ studios in Hamburg’s
Hammerbrook district. About 70 artists work in this house in a
district dominated by office buildings. Exhibitions, concerts and other
inter-disciplinary projects are regularly hosted in the art space Studio 45.
The space serves as an experimental laboratory to artistically investigate
the living spirit. Everyone is welcome!
