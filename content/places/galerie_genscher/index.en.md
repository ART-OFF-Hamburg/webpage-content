Since 2007, the exhibition programme has comprised presentations of
contemporary art by young artists and, in conjunction, readings, film
screenings, lectures and symposia. During the refurbishment of the
studio complex and the gallery space by the city authorities the gallery’s
programme was successfully transfered to alternative venues – such as
the “Container Gallery” on Millerntor square in St. Pauli.
