FAKTOR, formerly a cinema and located by the “Sternbrücke” bridge, is a large venue for interdisciplinary collaborations whose programme reflects
the diversity of interests of its members. In addition to regular exhibitions, the group hosts concerts, performances, film screenings and workshops. FAKTOR is a forum for experimentally exploring and debating convergences between various art forms.
