The nachtspeicher23 gallery, founded in 2008, is an alternative art space
in Hamburg‘s St. Georg district. Our aim is to bring contemporary art
closer to a broad audience, giving artists the opportunity and the space
to experiment. We encourage emerging talents and foster debate about a
variety of topics. Outside opening hours, exhibitions can also be viewed
through the gallery’s large display windows.
