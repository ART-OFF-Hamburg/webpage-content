The Gallery Oel-Früh owes its name to the eponymous venue previously
located at Brandshofer Deich (in Hamburg’s dockland) until 2012.
Re-launching in May 2019, the gallery will be presenting solo exhibitions
by supra-regional artists at a temporary location. Oel-Früh stands for
contemporary and independent art that has found a permanent place in
Hamburg for artists and cultural producers.
